Inspired by FAKENET-NG. Created to help analyze Agent Tesla samples which
often use SMTP for C2.

Since this was built with Agent Tesla in mind, this has only been tested against
.NET SmtpClient, the SMTP server may be unstable for other SMTP clients. 

For the DNS server to work, you must change Windows to use 127.0.0.1 as it's DNS server, 
and you must use the ```-d 53``` switch to have the DNS server listen on port 53.

Differences from FAKENET:
* Only for SMTP traffic. 
* Captures SMTP credentials.

## Usage

```powershell
# -l is the address to listen at.
# -p SMTP listen port.
# -d DNS listen port.
python3 fakemail.py -l 127.0.0.1 -p 25 -d 53
```

Testing:

```powershell
.\tests\Mailer.exe contoso.com 25
```
